# decdDECD is designed to find the differential expressed genes (DEGs) for 
complex diseases, which are characterizedby the heterogeneous expression 
profiles. Different from the established DEG analysis tools, it does 
notassume the patients of complex diseases to share the common DEGs. By 
applying a bi-clustering algorithm,DECD finds the DEGs shared by many 
patients. In this way, DECD describes the DEGs of complex diseasein a 
novel syntax, e.g. a gene list composed of 200 genes are differentially 
expressed in 30% percent of studiedcomplex disease patients.Applying the 
DECD analysis results, users are possible to find the patients affected 
by the same mechanismbased on the shared signatures. This can be achieved 
by modelling the breakpoints of the bi-clusteringanalysis and enrichment 
analysis to the feature patients or genes.
